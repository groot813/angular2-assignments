<!--ASSIGNMENT 4.3:
    the list we created below works but is currently mixed up with the search-block component. this can make it harder to read and understand
    migrate the part of this template and the component that is used for the overview to the "moviemanager-movie-list" component listed as a sibling of this components folder
